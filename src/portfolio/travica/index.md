The Fund loaned $1.2 million for the film based on the life of Vico C. Regarded by many as the father of urban music, Vico C, is a musical icon in Puerto Rico and around the world. This is a biopic project that is expected to be a success not only with the Puerto Rican market but also Latin American markets where Vico C was an icon during his career.
