# Green Isle Capital

Static site generator built with [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) and [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

## Usage

Note - you must have node installed.

```
git clone git@github.com:adamgibbons/green-isle-capital.git

cd green-isle-capital

npm install

The website is now compiled at `/build`, and you can view it locally by running a local/dev server. For example - 

```
cd build

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4020
```

Your site should now be running at [http://localhost:4020](http://localhost:4020)!
